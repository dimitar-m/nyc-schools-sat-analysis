# Top NYC Schools Revealed: SAT Scores and Survey Response Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between SAT scores and various survey responses from students, parents, and teachers across New York City high schools. By analyzing data on safety, communication, engagement, and academic expectations, we generate a composite score to rank schools and identify those excelling in multiple areas.

## Goals

The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights regarding how different factors, such as safety and engagement scores, impact SAT performance. By creating and visualizing a composite score based on multiple attributes, we aim to highlight the top-performing schools in NYC.

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was cleaned and relevant columns were renamed for clarity. We calculated composite scores using both survey responses and SAT scores.
   
2. **Visualization**: Multiple visualizations, including scatter plots and bar plots, were created to explore the relationships between survey responses and SAT scores. Each plot provides a clear view of how different survey scores correlate with academic performance.

3. **Analysis**: We examined the top schools based on the composite score and highlighted key findings from the survey responses. This helped us understand the factors contributing to high SAT scores.

## Key Findings

- Schools with higher safety and respect scores from students tend to have better SAT performance.
- Communication and engagement scores from both parents and teachers significantly influence overall academic results.
- The composite score effectively ranks schools by integrating multiple dimensions of school performance, providing a comprehensive view of educational quality.

## Conclusion

The project successfully identifies top-performing NYC high schools by combining survey responses with SAT scores. Through detailed analysis and visualizations, we provide valuable insights into how different survey metrics contribute to academic success.
